Senior Capstone Project

# Serenity
We decided to use technology as a pipeline to connect people with affordable mental healthcare: Serenity. A web-based application, Serenity aims to provide services that help a user monitor their mental health. In particular, it features a mood tracker, calming ambient music, and a meditation module based on the 4-square breathing technique. Our goal of developing Serenity is to provide a free and universal service that any individual can use from any device, and at any time of the day.
